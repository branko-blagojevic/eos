// A class which provides a preliminary check that a credentials file can be
// safely used by a particular uid.
//
// The strong check will be provided by XrdCl, which changes its fsuid on the
// thread that reads the credentials.
//
// There's a window of opportunity between this check and the time XrdCl reads
// the credentials that the underlying file can change, but as long as XrdCl
// does the fsuid trick, there's no possibility for a malicious user to trick
// us into using a credential file he does not have access to.
//
// You can also inject simulated data into this class, for use under test.
// If there's at least one injection, we completely ignore the filesystem
// and only serve injected data.
//
// TODO(gbitzes): Decide if we need to keep mtime in here.. would be cleaner
// if we didn't.
