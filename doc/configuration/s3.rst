S3 access
=======================

**S3** access is very similar to **HTTP** access. The **MGM** runs on port 8000
and the **FSTs** on port 8001.

Configuration
-------------

Within the S3 protocol, users are identified by an access key and secret key pair.
Buckets are associated to users and they constitute the place
where users write or read from.

Within EOS, users and buckets are registered as attributes of the
``/eos/**instance**/proc`` path.

To register users:
++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   attr set sys.s3.id.s3user=<secretkey> /eos/test/proc

*s3user* - the access key in S3 terminology

To register buckets:
++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   attr set sys.s3.bucket.s3user=testbucket /eos/test/proc
   attr set sys.s3.path.testbucket=/eos/test/s3dir /eos/test/proc

This will map the bucket called *testbucket* to the */eos/test/s3dir/* path.
It also specifies that this bucket belongs to user *s3user*.
